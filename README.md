# hello_world
This is a collaboration of several research and summer learning projects for web programming, and Python.

I am a newcomer to programming. I was brought here through many fortunate turns in my studies of Linguistics which led to a focus on Corpus linguistics and possibly a future with computational linguistics with enough luck. I also have strong yearnings to learn web-development.
